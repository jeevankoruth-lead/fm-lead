<p>Due to Stricter HSE Rules, Turning On an Office Light Should Be Made Safer
Once upon a time, turning on an office light was simple.
You walked in.
You pressed a switch.
Light happened.
End of story.
But that was before HSE discovered electricity is dangerous, humans are incompetent, and switches are basically weapons of mass destruction.
Now?
Turning on a light requires more safety protocols than launching a space shuttle.</p>
<hr>
<p>The New HSE Philosophy: Everything Is Unsafe Until Proven Otherwise
HSE used to be about preventing accidents.
Now it’s about preventing the possibility of the potential of the theoretical risk of an accident.
Which means:
A light switch is now a high risk, high voltage, life altering hazard.
You think I’m exaggerating?
Let’s walk through the new procedure.</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 1: Pre Switch Risk Assessment
Before touching the switch, you must complete:
•	A Job Hazard Analysis
•	A Permit to Work
•	A Toolbox Talk
•	A 14 page Safe Operating Procedure
•	A mental health check
•	A hydration check
•	A “Switch Readiness Survey”
Only then can you proceed to Step 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 2: Switch Activation PPE
To turn on a light, you must now wear:
•	Safety helmet
•	Safety goggles
•	Arc flash suit
•	Cut resistant gloves
•	Steel toe boots
•	High visibility vest
•	Knee pads
•	A harness
•	A second harness for emotional support
And of course, the mandatory Switch Operator Badge, which requires annual recertification.</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 3: The Light Switch Permit
You must request a Light Activation Permit (LAP 01).
This requires:
•	Approval from Facilities
•	Approval from HSE
•	Approval from Security
•	Approval from the Sustainability Team
•	Approval from someone who has no idea what’s happening but signs anyway
Permit validity: 3 minutes.
If you miss the window, start over.</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 4: The Buddy System
You cannot turn on a light alone.
You need:
•	A Switch Operator
•	A Switch Spotter
•	A Switch Safety Observer
•	A Switch Incident Recorder
•	A Switch Emergency Response Lead
This is known as the Five Man Light Activation Team™.</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 5: The Countdown
Before touching the switch, you must announce:
“LIGHT ACTIVATION IN PROGRESS. CLEAR THE AREA.”
Then perform a 10 second countdown.
During this time, all personnel must:
•	Stand behind a yellow line
•	Wear ear protection
•	Brace for impact</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 6: The Switch Flip
You may now gently, carefully, slowly, cautiously, delicately, respectfully, reverently touch the switch.
If the light turns on:
•	Celebrate safely
•	Document the success
•	File a “Light Activation Completion Report”
•	Attend a debrief session
If the light does NOT turn on:
•	Evacuate the building
•	Call emergency services
•	Conduct a root cause analysis
•	Blame the FM team</p>
<hr>
<p>Step 7: Post Switch Review Meeting
A 30 minute meeting is required to discuss:
•	What went well
•	What could be improved
•	Lessons learned
•	Emotional impact
•	Whether the switch felt respected
Minutes must be recorded and archived for 7 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why Stop There? Let’s Make It Even Safer.
Here are some proposed enhancements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Motion activated lights banned
Too unpredictable.
Lights should only activate with a permit.</li>
<li>Switches replaced with biometric scanners
Only certified Light Operators may illuminate a room.</li>
<li>Mandatory “Switch Warm Up Exercises”
To prevent finger strain.</li>
<li>Light Activation Training (LAT Level 1 to 5)
Because flipping a switch is a skill.</li>
<li>A dedicated Light Safety Officer (LSO)
To oversee all illumination events.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion: Turning On a Light Is Now a High Risk Operation
In the new world of stricter HSE rules, nothing is simple.
Not walking.
Not sitting.
Not breathing.
And definitely not turning on a light.
Because safety isn’t just a priority — it’s a lifestyle.
A religion.
A sacred ritual.
And if you think this is overkill?
You clearly don’t care about safety.</p>
<hr>
<p>Near missing reporting should be done every waking moment</p>
<hr>
<p>Near Miss Reporting Should Be Done Every Waking Moment
Near miss reporting used to be simple.
Something almost went wrong?
You report it.
Done.
But that was before HSE realized the truth:
<strong>Everything is a near miss.
All the time.
Forever.</strong>
Which means the only responsible thing to do is report near misses every waking moment, until your entire life becomes one continuous safety confession.</p>
<hr>
<p>The New HSE Doctrine: If It Didn’t Kill You, Report It
In the modern CRES world, a near miss isn’t just:
•	A falling object
•	A slip
•	A trip
•	A tool dropped from height
No.
That’s old school thinking.
Now, a near miss is:
•	Walking
•	Standing
•	Sitting
•	Breathing
•	Thinking
•	Existing
Because technically, anything could have gone wrong.
And therefore, it must be reported.</p>
<hr>
<p>The 24/7 Near Miss Lifestyle
HSE wants you to be vigilant.
Hyper aware.
Paranoid, even.
So now, every Facilities professional must live in a constant state of:
•	Observation
•	Documentation
•	Reporting
•	Self reflection
•	Mild existential dread
You’re not just doing your job — you’re starring in a never ending safety documentary.</p>
<hr>
<p>Examples of Modern Near Misses
Here are some real world scenarios that now qualify:</p>
<ol>
<li>You walked past a chair.
It could have broken.
Near miss.</li>
<li>You opened a door.
It could have hit someone.
Near miss.</li>
<li>You drank water.
You could have choked.
Near miss.</li>
<li>You looked at a ladder.
You could have fallen off it… in theory.
Near miss.</li>
<li>You thought about doing work.
You could have strained your brain.
Near miss.
Report them all.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The Near Miss Reporting Kit™
To support this new lifestyle, every employee must carry:
•	A Near Miss Logbook
•	A backup Near Miss Logbook
•	A pen
•	A backup pen
•	A body worn camera
•	A panic whistle
•	A reflective vest labeled “NEAR MISS OBSERVER”
Optional:
A therapist.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Near Miss Reporting Frequency Standard
HSE recommends reporting:
•	1 near miss every hour (Beginner)
•	1 near miss every 10 minutes (Intermediate)
•	1 near miss every 30 seconds (Advanced)
•	Continuous near miss streaming (Expert Level / CRES Professional)
By the time you reach Expert Level, you no longer work — you simply report.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Near Miss Pyramid of Doom™
Here’s the scientifically accurate model:
Level	Description
Top	Actual Incident
2	Serious Near Miss
3	Minor Near Miss
4	Imagined Near Miss
5	Hypothetical Near Miss
6	Theoretical Near Miss
Bottom	“I felt like something might have happened”
The goal is to fill the bottom layer until the pyramid collapses under its own weight.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Near Miss Hotline
To improve reporting efficiency, CRES should implement:
•	A 24/7 hotline
•	A mobile app
•	A chatbot
•	A panic button
•	A wearable sensor that auto reports near misses when your heart rate increases
Soon, your smartwatch will vibrate and say:
“You almost tripped over nothing. Report submitted.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The Ultimate Goal: Zero Incidents, Infinite Reports
HSE dreams of a world where:
•	Nothing bad ever happens
•	But everything is reported anyway
This is known as the Safety Paradox:
The safer things get, the more unsafe we must pretend they are.</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclusion: Near Miss Reporting Should Never Stop
In the new world of Facilities and CRES:
•	Every moment is a hazard
•	Every action is a risk
•	Every breath is a near miss
So report it.
All of it.
Forever.
Because safety isn’t just a priority — it’s a full time job.
And you’re never off duty.</p>

Employees Working on Any Floor Above Ground Floor Are Officially “Working at Heights”
Once upon a time, “working at heights” meant something simple:
•	Climbing a ladder
•	Standing on scaffolding
•	Hanging off the side of a building like a Spider Man intern
But that was before HSE discovered a terrifying truth:
**Anything above ground level is technically a height.
Therefore, everyone is always working at heights.**
Congratulations.
If you work on the 1st floor, you’re basically a stunt performer now.

The New HSE Definition of Height
Old definition:
“Any work conducted at a height where a fall could cause injury.”
New definition:
“Any work conducted anywhere that is not the literal ground.”
This includes:
•	First floor
•	Second floor
•	Third floor
•	Mezzanine
•	Staircase
•	Escalator
•	A slightly raised platform
•	A thick carpet
•	A yoga mat
If your feet are not touching soil, you are at risk.

The Ground Floor Privilege
Ground floor employees now enjoy:
•	Height free working
•	No harnesses
•	No fall arrest systems
•	No HSE lectures about gravity
Meanwhile, everyone else is living in a vertical war zone.

Mandatory PPE for “Height Workers”
If you work on any floor above ground, you must now wear:
•	Full body harness
•	Shock absorbing lanyard
•	Helmet
•	Chin strap
•	Steel toe boots
•	High visibility vest labeled “HEIGHT RISK: LEVEL 1”
•	Optional parachute (recommended for floors 3 and above)
Even if you’re just sitting at your desk.

The New Office Layout: Fall Protection Everywhere
To comply with the new rules, Facilities must install:
•	Guardrails around every desk
•	Safety nets under every cubicle
•	Anchor points in meeting rooms
•	Fall arrest lines in the pantry
•	A rescue plan for anyone who stands on a chair to change the AC setting
The office now looks like a construction site married a circus.

The Height Permit to Work (HPW 01)
Before entering any floor above ground, employees must obtain:
•	A Height Permit
•	A Fall Risk Assessment
•	A Method Statement for “Walking Around”
•	A Rescue Plan for “Standing Up”
•	A Supervisor’s Approval
•	A Safety Observer
Permit validity: 30 minutes.
If you go to the washroom, you need a new permit.

The Staircase: Now a High Risk Zone
Stairs are no longer stairs.
They are multi level vertical hazard platforms.
To use them, you must:
•	Wear PPE
•	Hold the handrail
•	Maintain three points of contact
•	Walk at 0.5 km/h
•	Announce your ascent or descent loudly
If two people meet on the stairs, one must retreat and reapply for a permit.

The Elevator: A Suspended Death Box
Since elevators leave the ground, they are now classified as:
“Enclosed Height Risk Transport Capsules.”
To use one, you must:
•	Attend a safety briefing
•	Sign a waiver
•	Wear a harness
•	Clip into the elevator’s anchor point
•	Maintain emotional stability
If the elevator moves too fast, report a near miss.
________________________________________
The Height Safety Induction
All employees above ground floor must attend a 3 hour induction covering:
•	Gravity awareness
•	Fall psychology
•	Safe walking techniques
•	Desk edge hazard zones
•	Proper sitting posture to avoid “chair related descent events”
A written exam follows.
Passing score: 95%.

Conclusion: Every Floor Is a Height, Every Employee Is a Risk
In the new world of HSE:
•	Gravity is the enemy
•	Floors are dangerous
•	Stairs are death traps
•	Elevators are vertical coffins
•	And anyone above ground level is basically a mountaineer
So strap in.
Clip on.
Harness up.
Because in Facilities and CRES, safety isn’t just a priority — it’s a full time lifestyle.

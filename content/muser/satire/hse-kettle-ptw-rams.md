Before Using the Office Kettle, Staff Must Complete RAMS
There was a time — a simpler, more innocent era — when making tea at work involved:
1.	Walking to the pantry
2.	Turning on the kettle
3.	Drinking tea
But that was before HSE discovered the kettle is basically a boiling, steaming, electrically charged death machine waiting to unleash chaos.
Now?
Before you even look at the kettle, you must complete:
RAMS — Risk Assessment & Method Statement
Because nothing says “competent adult” like needing a 12 page document to boil water.

The New HSE Truth: Kettles Are Lethal Weapons
According to modern safety doctrine, kettles are responsible for:
•	Burns
•	Scalds
•	Steam injuries
•	Electrical hazards
•	Slips
•	Trips
•	Falls
•	Emotional trauma
•	Existential dread
•	And the possibility — however remote — of someone getting slightly wet
Therefore, kettles must be treated with the same seriousness as:
•	High voltage switchgear
•	Confined space entry
•	Nuclear reactors
•	Summoning demons

The Kettle RAMS Process™
Here’s the new, mandatory, HSE approved procedure for making tea:
________________________________________
Step 1: Pre Boil Risk Assessment
Before touching the kettle, you must:
•	Identify hazards
•	Evaluate risks
•	Mitigate risks
•	Document risks
•	Sign off risks
•	Get your manager to sign off
•	Get HSE to sign off
•	Get the Sustainability Team to sign off
•	Get Security to sign off
•	Get the pantry cleaner to sign off
Only then may you proceed.

Step 2: Method Statement for Boiling Water
Your Method Statement must include:
•	Step by step kettle activation sequence
•	Hand placement diagrams
•	Steam avoidance strategies
•	Water pouring angles
•	Emergency shutdown procedures
•	A contingency plan in case the kettle refuses to cooperate
This document must be laminated and stored next to the kettle.
________________________________________
Step 3: Mandatory PPE
To boil water safely, staff must wear:
•	Heat resistant gloves
•	Safety goggles
•	Apron
•	Steel toe boots
•	Arc flash suit (optional but recommended)
•	Hairnet
•	High visibility vest labeled “KETTLE OPERATOR”
If you’re pouring water, add a face shield.
________________________________________
Step 4: Kettle Permit to Work (PTW KTL 01)
You must apply for a Kettle Permit, valid for exactly 5 minutes.
Permit requires:
•	Purpose of boiling
•	Expected water temperature
•	Number of tea bags involved
•	Environmental impact statement
•	Emergency contact details
If the permit expires mid boil, you must abort the operation.
________________________________________
Step 5: The Buddy System
You cannot boil water alone.
You need:
•	A Kettle Operator
•	A Kettle Spotter
•	A Steam Safety Observer
•	A Spill Response Lead
•	A Documentation Controller
This is known as the Five Man Tea Team™.
________________________________________
Step 6: The Boil
You may now activate the kettle.
But first, announce loudly:
“BOILING IN PROGRESS. CLEAR THE AREA.”
All personnel must stand behind the yellow line.
If the kettle clicks, you must:
•	Log the event
•	Notify HSE
•	Conduct a post boil debrief
________________________________________
Post Boil Reporting Requirements
After making tea, you must complete:
•	A Boil Completion Report
•	A Steam Exposure Log
•	A Water Dispensing Risk Review
•	A Lessons Learned Summary
•	A Near Miss Declaration (mandatory even if nothing happened)
All documents must be archived for 10 years.

Why Stop There? Let’s Make It Even Safer.
Proposed enhancements:
1. Kettle Training Certification (KTC Level 1–4)
Because boiling water is a skill.
2. Kettle Safety Induction Video
Mandatory viewing every Monday.
3. Kettle Lockout Tagout (LOTO)
To prevent unauthorized boiling.
4. Kettle Operator Licensing
Annual renewal, written exam included.
5. Kettle Safety Drills
Simulated steam emergencies every quarter.

Conclusion: Tea Is Dangerous. Act Accordingly.
In today’s CRES/HSE environment, nothing is simple.
Not walking.
Not sitting.
Not breathing.
And definitely not boiling water.
Because safety isn’t just a priority — it’s a lifestyle.
A philosophy.
A sacred ritual.
And if you think this is overkill?
You clearly don’t care about employee wellbeing.

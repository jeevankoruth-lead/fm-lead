Sustainability in CRES: Why We Should All Just Become Cavemen Again
Corporate Real Estate Services (CRES) loves sustainability. LOVES it. If sustainability were a person, CRES would have already proposed, married it, and posted 47 LinkedIn carousels about the wedding.
Every company now has a “Sustainability Roadmap,” which is basically a glossy PDF that says:
“We promise to use fewer resources… eventually… maybe… if the budget committee approves it.”
But here’s the truth no one wants to admit:
If you REALLY want sustainability, there’s only one solution.
Shut everything down.
Turn off the lights.
Throw away your shoes.
Become a caveman.
Because apparently, the only truly sustainable building is the one that doesn’t exist.

The Corporate Sustainability Paradox™
CRES teams proudly announce:
•	“We reduced energy consumption by 3% this quarter!”
•	“We installed motion sensors in the pantry!”
•	“We replaced plastic stirrers with bamboo ones that cost 8x more but make us feel morally superior!”
Meanwhile, the same company is constructing a new 40 story glass tower in the desert because “it aligns with our long-term sustainability vision.”
Yes.
A skyscraper.
In the desert.
Where the sun tries to kill you daily.
But don’t worry — it has a LEED Gold plaque the size of a dinner plate, so everything is fine.

The Only Truly Sustainable Office Is a Cave
Let’s stop pretending.
If you want REAL sustainability, here’s the only acceptable CRES strategy:
Step 1: Evict everyone from the office.
People use electricity. Electricity is bad.
Problem solved.
Step 2: Demolish the building.
Concrete = carbon.
Steel = carbon.
Glass = carbon.
Your building is basically a giant CO₂ piñata.
Step 3: Replace it with a cave.
Not a fancy cave.
Not a “biophilic, nature-inspired, open-plan cave.”
A real cave.
Dark, damp, and full of bats.
Congratulations.
You are now 100% sustainable.

Net Zero? Please. Try Net Nothing.
CRES loves buzzwords:
•	Net Zero
•	Carbon Neutral
•	Circular Economy
•	Regenerative Design
•	“Holistic Workplace Ecosystem Synergy” (yes, someone has said this unironically)
But none of these compare to the ultimate sustainability metric:
Net Nothing™
The only KPI that matters.
•	No energy use
•	No water use
•	No HVAC
•	No waste
•	No employees complaining about the AC being too cold
Because there are no employees.
Because you fired them.
Because sustainability.

The Caveman Workplace Experience (CWX™)
Imagine the annual CRES report:
“This year, we transitioned our workforce to a fully primitive operational model.”
Employees now enjoy:
•	Natural ventilation (wind blowing through cave holes)
•	Zero-waste sanitation (just… don’t ask)
•	Organic lighting (the sun, sometimes)
•	Flexible seating (rocks)
•	Biophilic design (moss, bats, occasional snakes)
And best of all:
No carbon footprint.
Because you’re barefoot.

Sustainability Certifications in the Caveman Era
Introducing the new industry standards:
Certification	Requirement
LEED: Stone Age Platinum	No building exists
WELL: Barefoot Edition	No shoes, no problem
BREEAM: Prehistoric	Fire allowed only if rubbed with sticks
Fitwel: Caveman+	Daily cardio from running away from predators
Finally, certifications that mean something.

Conclusion: If You’re Not Living in a Cave, You Hate the Planet
CRES professionals keep trying to make sustainability “practical” and “balanced” and “aligned with business goals.”
Wrong.
If you’re not ready to:
•	abandon modern infrastructure
•	reject all comfort
•	and live like a Neanderthal
…then clearly you don’t care about the environment.
So grab a rock.
Find a cave.
And welcome to the future of sustainable corporate real estate.

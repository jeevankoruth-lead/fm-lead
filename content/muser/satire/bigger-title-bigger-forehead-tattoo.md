The Bigger Your Job Title, the Bigger Your Forehead Sticker Should Be
Corporate hierarchy used to be simple:
•	Junior staff did the work
•	Managers took the credit
•	Directors took the blame
•	VPs took the bonuses
But in today’s Facilities and CRES world, titles have evolved into status symbols, and status symbols must be visible.
Which is why I propose the only fair, transparent, scientifically correct system:
The bigger your title, the bigger your forehead sticker should be.
Because nothing says “leadership” like a giant fluorescent label slapped across your skull.

Why Forehead Stickers? Because Accountability Should Be Visible
In the modern workplace:
•	ID cards are too small
•	Email signatures are too subtle
•	LinkedIn titles are too easy to fake
But a forehead sticker?
That’s commitment.
That’s authenticity.
That’s leadership you can see.

The Official Forehead Sticker Size Chart™
To ensure fairness, here is the standardized sticker sizing system:
Title	Sticker Size	Description
Intern	1 cm	Small, humble, barely visible
Coordinator	3 cm	Enough to show you exist
Supervisor	5 cm	Slightly annoying, like the job
Manager	8 cm	Covers 20% of forehead
Senior Manager	12 cm	Now we’re getting serious
Head of Department	18 cm	Visible from across the office
Director	25 cm	Requires neck support
Senior Director	30 cm	Blocks peripheral vision
VP	40 cm	Looks like a construction sign
SVP	50 cm	Must be carried by two assistants
C Suite	Full face wrap	You are now a walking billboard
This is the only way to ensure everyone knows exactly how important you think you are.

Sticker Colors Based on Authority Level
To avoid confusion, stickers must follow the Corporate Dominance Color Code™:
•	Green: You can approve small things
•	Yellow: You can approve medium things
•	Orange: You can approve big things
•	Red: You can approve nothing but pretend you can
•	Black: You are the CEO
If your sticker glows in the dark, you’re probably in Finance.

The Sticker Ceremony
When someone gets promoted, HR must conduct the sacred ritual:
1.	Gather the team
2.	Play dramatic music
3.	Peel the sticker backing slowly
4.	Apply it to the forehead with corporate precision
5.	Step back and admire the new authority level
Tears are optional but encouraged.

Benefits of the Forehead Sticker System
1. Instant Recognition
No more guessing who’s in charge.
Just look for the biggest sticker.
2. Reduced Email Confusion
No more “Who should approve this?”
Just find the person whose forehead looks like a highway sign.
3. Improved Accountability
If something goes wrong, blame the biggest sticker in the room.
4. Enhanced Leadership Presence
Nothing commands respect like a 40 cm fluorescent rectangle stuck to your face.

Special Stickers for Facilities & CRES
Because our industry deserves its own flair:
•	“BMS Whisperer” — holographic

Sticker Violations and Penalties
To maintain order, the following are strictly prohibited:
•	Wearing a sticker larger than your title allows
•	Tilting your sticker to look cool
•	Covering your sticker with hair
•	Sharing stickers
•	Sticker inflation (adding extra layers for dominance)
Violators must attend a mandatory Sticker Ethics Workshop.

Conclusion: Leadership Should Be Loud, Bright, and Plastered on Your Forehead
In the modern corporate world:
•	Titles are currency
•	Visibility is power
•	Ego is infrastructure
So let’s stop pretending humility is a virtue.
If you’re important, your forehead should show it.
If you’re very important, your forehead should glow like a runway light.
Because in CRES and Facilities, the only thing bigger than the problems…
is the leadership sticker required to approve them.

Your actual top technical performers should be asset tagged and added in asset list

High performance team members should be asset tagged
________________________________________
Your Actual Top Technical Performers Should Be Asset Tagged and Added to the Asset List
In Facilities and CRES, we track everything:
•	Pumps
•	Panels
•	AHUs
•	Tools
•	Coffee machines
•	The one ladder everyone fights over
But the most valuable asset of all?
Your top technical performers.
And yet… they’re not tagged.
They’re not barcoded.
They’re not even in the CMMS.
This is a crime against asset management.
________________________________________
Why Treat Them Like Humans When You Can Treat Them Like Assets?
Think about it:
•	They respond faster than your BMS
•	They troubleshoot better than your OEM
•	They know more about the building than the drawings do
•	They prevent more breakdowns than your entire preventive maintenance plan
So why are they not:
•	Tagged
•	Serialized
•	Categorized
•	Depreciated
•	Audited
This is operational negligence.
________________________________________
Introducing the Human Asset Tagging Program (HATP™)
To fix this, we must implement a new standard:
Every top performer gets an asset tag on their forehead, shoulder, or hard hat.
This tag includes:
•	Asset ID
•	Skill category
•	Response time
•	Warranty period (until burnout)
•	Maintenance schedule (coffee, snacks, occasional praise)
•	OEM (their parents)
________________________________________
The CMMS Needs a New Category: “Human Assets”
Your asset list should now include:
Asset ID	Name	Type	Condition	Notes
HA 001	Ramesh	HVAC Specialist	Excellent	Knows every chiller by sound
HA 002	Ahmed	Electrical Tech	Good	Can fix anything except his own leave balance
HA 003	Sunil	BMS Guru	Critical	Must not be allowed to resign
HA 004	Priya	FM All Rounder	Outstanding	Runs the building better than management
These are your real Tier IV assets.

Routine Maintenance for Human Assets
Just like machines, human assets require maintenance:
1. Lubrication
Also known as coffee.
2. Cooling
Also known as AC set to 19°C in the control room.
3. Calibration
Also known as training.
4. Preventive Maintenance
Also known as letting them take leave once every three years.
5. Emergency Repairs
Also known as HR interventions.
________________________________________
Human Asset Depreciation
Machines depreciate.
People burn out.
So your CMMS should automatically calculate:
•	Annual skill depreciation
•	Stress related performance drop
•	Motivation decay curve
•	Probability of resignation
If the system detects “low morale,” it should trigger a Corrective Action Work Order:
“Provide praise, recognition, or pizza.”
________________________________________
Annual Asset Audit
During the yearly audit, the auditor must:
•	Scan each technician
•	Verify their serial number
•	Check for missing parts (sanity, patience, will to live)
•	Confirm they haven’t been transferred without documentation
•	Ensure they’re still functional
If a technician is found hiding in the pantry, mark them as “temporarily offline.”
________________________________________
Human Asset Warranty
Top performers should come with:
•	1 year limited warranty
•	3 year extended warranty (if fed properly)
•	Lifetime warranty (if you pay them what they’re worth)
Warranty void if:
•	Overworked
•	Underpaid
•	Ignored
•	Forced to attend unnecessary meetings
________________________________________
Conclusion: If They’re Valuable, Tag Them
In CRES and Facilities:
•	We track everything
•	We tag everything
•	We log everything
Except the people who actually keep the building alive.
So let’s fix that.
Tag them.
Register them.
Maintain them.
Protect them.
Because your top technical performers aren’t just employees —
they’re your most critical assets.
And if you don’t treat them like assets?
They’ll walk out the door.
And unlike pumps, you can’t order replacements from the OEM.

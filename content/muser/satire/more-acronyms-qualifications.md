Becoming the #1 Facilities/CRES Professional: Just Collect Every Acronym in Human History
Some people become great by mastering their craft.
Others become great by leading teams, solving problems, and delivering results.
But in Corporate Real Estate and Facilities Management?
No.
That’s amateur hour.
If you want to be the #1 CRES professional on Earth, there’s only one path:
Collect every credential acronym in existence. All of them. Even the ones that don’t exist yet.
Because nothing screams “competence” like a LinkedIn headline that looks like someone smashed their keyboard during a seizure.

The Acronym Arms Race
Once upon a time, having a degree was enough.
Then someone got a certification.
Then someone else got two certifications.
Then a third guy showed up with a badge that said “Sustainability Ninja Level 4.”
And now?
Your email signature needs to look like the periodic table just to get invited to a Zoom call.

The Modern CRES Professional’s Signature Block
Here’s what the average Facilities Manager’s signature looks like today:
John Doe, B.Eng, MBA, CFM, FMP, SFP, RPA, SMA, LEED AP, WELL AP, PMP, PgMP, CMMS-GOD, HVAC-WIZARD, OSHA-OVERLORD, ISO-9001-9002-9003-9004-9005-9006-9007-9008-9009 MASTER PRACTITIONER
And that’s just the first line.
Below that, you’ll find:
•	14 logos
•	6 QR codes
•	A motivational quote
•	A confidentiality disclaimer longer than the Bible
But hey — he’s certified.

The Logic Behind the Acronym Addiction
Let’s break down the reasoning:
1. More letters = more respect
If your name doesn’t look like a Wi-Fi password, are you even qualified?
2. Recruiters love alphabet soup
They don’t know what half the acronyms mean, but they assume you’re important.
3. Your parents finally think you’re successful
They don’t understand your job, but they can brag about the letters.
4. You can charge more
Because nothing justifies a higher salary like a badge that required a 90 minute online quiz.

Introducing the Ultimate Credential: The G.O.A.T.
After years of research, I’ve created the only certification that truly matters:
G.O.A.T. — Grand Overlord of All Titles
Requirements:
•	Pay a fee
•	Add the letters to your name
•	That’s it
Congratulations.
You’re now more qualified than everyone else.

Why Stop at Real Credentials? Invent Your Own.
If you really want to dominate the industry, you need to go beyond the standard acronyms.
Here are some new ones you can add to your LinkedIn profile today:
Acronym	Meaning
FM GOD	Facilities Management Grand Omnipotent Director
CRE NINJA	Corporate Real Estate Ninja (Stealth Mode Certified)
HVAC SORCERER	Controls temperature using magic and passive-aggressive emails
BMS WHISPERER	Can communicate with the building management system without rebooting it
CHAIR ERGONOMIST	Adjusts chairs with spiritual precision
COFFEE FLOW MASTER	Ensures pantry uptime of 99.999%
These are guaranteed to impress absolutely everyone, especially people who don’t know what you do.

The Final Evolution: The Infinite Acronym Loop
Once you’ve collected every credential on Earth, you must ascend to the final form:
**Create new credentials for yourself.
Then certify yourself.
Then award yourself the certification.**
This is known as the Self Licking Ice Cream Cone Model of Professional Excellence™.
It is flawless.

Conclusion: If You Don’t Have 47 Acronyms, You’re Basically Unemployed
In the Facilities/CRES world, competence is optional.
Experience is optional.
Results are optional.
But acronyms?
Mandatory.
If your name doesn’t look like encrypted military intelligence, you’re not even in the game.
So go forth.
Collect letters.
Fill your signature.
Become the alphabet.
Because in this industry, the only thing more sustainable than buildings…
is the endless supply of new certifications.
